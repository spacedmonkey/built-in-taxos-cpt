# Built-in Taxonomies on Custom Post Types 

Simple plugin that adds support for tags and category to custom post types. This fixes a "bug" in core. For more detail look [here](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14589) and [here](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19471). This plugin has no ui, as it is not required. Simply install and activate to get working.
